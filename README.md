# ClimateEducation_AI

This repository provides scripts and datasets for the analysis provided in our paper: A scoping review on climate change education, Veruska Muccione, Tracy Ewen, Saeid Ashraf Vaghefi, EarthArXiv: https://eartharxiv.org/repository/view/5731/

Our paper provides a first-of-its kind mapping of the literature on climate change education to better understand topic relationships and spatial distribution, and highlight potential new avenues for research on climate education.  Machine learning methods including semantic analysis, geoparsing and topic modeling are used to supportour study.  

The climate GPT2 model for the final classification task is in the folder  `cgpt_classification`. The non gpt based models are in `ClassificationModels_Seen_Unseen_ver2.ipynb`. The semantic analysis, topic modleing and geoparsing are in `Analysis_GPT2_Classifcation_June2023.ipynb`. For the dataset with the abstracts and datasets with the labels, please contact the authors.
