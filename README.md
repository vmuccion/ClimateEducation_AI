# ClimateEducation_AI
Project on the climate education review research. The climate GPT2 model for the final classification task is in the folder  `cgpt_classification`. The non gpt based models are in `ClassificationModels_Seen_Unseen_ver2.ipynb`. The semantic analysis, topic modleing and geoparsing are in `Analysis_GPT2_Classifcation_June2023.ipynb`.

As of November 2023, two new versions have also been uploaded which are `Analysis_GPT2_Classifcation_October2023.ipynb` which contains updates on the topic modeling, semantic analysis and geoparsing. The classifier has also been updated in `cgpt_classification/ClimateGPT_Education_Classifier_October2023.ipynb`

As of September 2024, two new versions have also been uploaded which are `Analysis_GPT2_Classifcation_September2024_revised.ipynb` which contains updates on the topic modeling, semantic analysis and geoparsing as well as further 
analysis here `AdditionalAnalysis_ClimateEducation_September2024_review.ipynb`.
