# ClimateEducation_AI

This project focuses on climate education review research, utilizing various models and methods to analyze and classify climate-related data.

## Contents

1. **GPT-2 Classification**
   - The final classification task using the Climate GPT-2 model can be found in the folder: **`cgpt_classification`**.
   - Updated classifier version: **`cgpt_classification/ClimateGPT_Education_Classifier_October2023.ipynb`**.

2. **Non-GPT Classification Models**
   - Explore our non-GPT-based models in the notebook: **`ClassificationModels_Seen_Unseen_ver2.ipynb`**.

3. **Analysis Notebooks**
   - We provide several analysis notebooks containing updates on semantic analysis, topic modeling, and geoparsing:
     - **`Analysis_GPT2_Classifcation_June2023.ipynb`**: Initial analysis results.
     - **`Analysis_GPT2_Classifcation_October2023.ipynb`**: Updated findings from October 2023.
     - **`Analysis_GPT2_Classifcation_September2024_revised.ipynb`**: Revised results from September 2024.
     - **`AdditionalAnalysis_ClimateEducation_September2024_review.ipynb`**: Further analysis and insights.

## Accessing Text Summarization
